## Overview
  
  To just recap the challenge,  This is a QR-Code component project of a Newbie level HTML and CSS
  only Challenge.  
   This challenge actually doesn't need a responsive style ,  Becuase the project can fit in both largest and smallest devices.  
   And It was a great exercise for really newbie level Developers to practice and Improve their 
   skill of Positioning , Guessing the (width, padding , margin ,font-size etc...) and also image positioning.
   I am Actually greatful to complete this challenge on my own.  

### Links

  Unfortunately,  I Didn't use any outside link in this project and no preference links for the
  Solution.

## My process

  First , I took a deep view on the design image of the final project,

  Then,  I Tried to identify the amount and types of containers and Tags used
         in the project (header, paragraph ,div ,span etc...),

  Finally , I started styling those html Tags one by one from the top.  

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Actually , I didn't learn new things from this challenge,  but it is a good execise
 to me to practice real life experiences.

```css
.life-saver {
  padding: 30px;
}
```

### Continued development

 I think, i have the basic understanding of HTML  and a mid-level understanding of css Which I have been Practicing for over 21+ Months.  so, I'm Eager to learn and practice new projects and challenges specially Building Responsive Websites ,  Css animations , scroll-based animations and also basic projects on Javascript Objects.  Thank You!
